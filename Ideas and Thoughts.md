# Mood-board / Brainstorm:

Got it! Based on these references, your website could embrace a _soft pastel, watercolor-inspired aesthetic_ with elements like:

## Color Palette

Soft blues, pinks, and purples with muted, desaturated tones for a dreamy feel.
Gentle gradients that mimic watercolor washes.
Pops of brighter colors (like coral or cyan) to add contrast.

## Font Suggestions

For a calm, demure, and positive vibe that fits the art style, consider:

Nunito – Rounded, soft, and friendly.
Quicksand – Gentle and modern, complementing pastel visuals.
Poppins – Minimal but warm, works well for headers.
Raleway – Light and elegant, great for a stylish touch.
Pacifico – A script font with a hand-drawn, fluid feel to match the watercolor look.

## Design Elements

Soft, rounded UI elements (buttons, cards, etc.).
Gentle drop shadows and layering to create depth without harsh contrasts.
Wavy dividers and organic shapes inspired by the flowing nature of the art style.
Subtle animations, like floating clouds or slow fades, to enhance the dreamy vibe.

## Layout and UI ideas

_inspired by the Steven Universe background art style, blending a pastel, watercolor aesthetic with a clean and inviting design_

1. Layout Ideas
   A. Hero Section (Landing Page Top)
   - Visual: A large, soft gradient background with cloud-like shapes or waves.
   - Typography: A welcoming, friendly heading in Nunito or Quicksand, with a smaller, handwritten-style subheading.
   - Elements: Floating elements like stars, gems, or subtle sparkles that animate on hover.
   - Call to Action (CTA): A soft, rounded button with pastel tones (e.g., “Enter My World” or “Let’s Explore”).
     B. About Section
   - Layout: Split-screen with text on one side and an illustration or stylized self-portrait on the other.
   - Background: A light watercolor wash with gentle waves or geometric pastel shapes.
   - Typography: Use soft colors with well-spaced text for readability.
     C. Portfolio/Projects Section
   - Layout: Masonry grid with pastel hover effects.
   - Cards: Rounded cards with a shadow that mimics a watercolor effect.
   - Filters: Gentle pill-shaped category filters (e.g., “Illustration,” “Coding,” “Writing”).
     D. Contact Section
   - Visual: A floating island or celestial theme with icons designed as stars or clouds.
   - Form: Rounded input fields with soft inner shadows and playful placeholder text (e.g., “Shoot me a star!”).
2. UI Elements
   A. Buttons
   Rounded, soft edges, with pastel gradients and subtle hover effects.
   Example: A light pink button that turns slightly darker with a wavy underline on hover.
   B. Navigation Bar
   A floating navbar with a translucent, glassy pastel effect.
   Use soft icons that fit the whimsical style (stars, clouds, or hand-drawn elements).
   C. Dividers
   Wavy, hand-drawn lines or gradient transitions that blend one section into another smoothly.
   Floating gemstone or bubble accents between sections.
   D. Backgrounds
   Gradient washes mimicking the sky at dawn/dusk (pale pinks, yellows, purples).
   Abstract cloud shapes that move subtly with parallax effects.
3. Interaction Ideas
   Hover Effects: Elements gently expand and change color when hovered over.
   Scroll Effects: Soft fade-ins, parallax on background clouds, and text that “floats” up.
   Loading Animation: A gem slowly spinning or stars twinkling to reinforce the theme.

- Should I use Github Pages, Neocities, etc for hosting my site?
- Should I use Jekyll or create my own blog system?
- What other features/sections do I want besides articles / blog site?
