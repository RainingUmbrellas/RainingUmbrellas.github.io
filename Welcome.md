Hi everyone, my name is RainingUmbrellas and welcome to my personal website.

I am a developer by trade with a number of interests, programming, languages, art, etc, which .

I'm creating a personal website because of a few reasons.

# So I hope you enjoy my random thoughts, rants, and projects!

Towards the end of 2024, I had the realization that I only really consume things and I haven't really created anything outside of work. When I was younger, I had a ton of ideas and I would like to think that I was a creative kid, and pretty curious. As I have gotten older, I don't physically create anything, but I will have ideas from time to time.
